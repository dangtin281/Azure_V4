I Machine learning Deep learning Computer vision NLP Projects with code

The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following four guidelines:

From outline to detail
From old to state-of-the-art
from generic to specific areas
focus on state-of-the-art
You will find many papers that are quite new but really worth reading.

I would continue adding papers to this roadmap.

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)
International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)
IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)
IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)
International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)
International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)
Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)


Which Python version should I use?

I recommend Python 3.7. If you follow the installation instructions above, that's the version you will get. Most code will work with other versions of Python 3, but some libraries do not support Python 3.8 or 3.9 yet, which is why I recommend Python 3.7.

I'm getting an error when I call load_housing_data()

Make sure you call fetch_housing_data() before you call load_housing_data(). If you're getting an HTTP error, make sure you're running the exact same code as in the notebook (copy/paste it if needed). If the problem persists, please check your network configuration.
